        <p>
            Dear friends,
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, we face a heartbreaking reality. Macker 1, our shared haven of stories, laughter, and unforgettable moments, must come to an end. This little corner of the internet brought us together, making us laugh, cry, and feel alive. But now, the lights are dimming, and the curtain is closing on this beautiful chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our dream was to make entertainment free for everyone, a place where connection thrived. But dreams, no matter how magical, require support to stay alive. Offering free accounts to spread joy was our mission, but it also left us unable to bear the costs of keeping Macker 1 alive. The domain, the servers, the heartbeat of our service—all slipping away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet, hope remains. Together, we can rewrite this ending. If we gather just <span class="donate">€15</span>, we can keep Macker 1 alive for another year. Imagine—another year of laughter, comfort, and connection. Your support, no matter how small, can breathe life back into our dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don’t let this be the final goodbye. With your help, Macker 1 can rise again, stronger and more resilient than ever. And if our community continues to support us each year, this cherished service could stay alive for years to come.
        </p>
        <p class="final-note">
            For the last time (or perhaps not), this is Macker 1 signing off... Thank you for being part of our story. Let’s keep it going.
